## History 

The startup files have accumulated over the last 30+ years.  It has
accumulated some cruft over the years.  In 2018 I sat down and started
refactoring and removed support for ancient capabilities (e.g. Stratus
VOS) from the elisp, but it was still crufty.  In 2023 I started a
second round, This most recent refactor wasn't so much a refactor as
it was a delete everything and rewrite anything I still wanted.
