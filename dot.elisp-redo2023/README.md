# 2023 Rewrite

Desired features
- lsp based IDE
- support for something like msvc-load-project that can handle different types of project files.
- functions from c_functions.el (probably all, but there might be one or two that get cut.)
- keys for GUD.
- probably bring in realgud-lldb
- support for different indentation styles (easily customized for working on code from different projects.)
- find out if there are more modern ways of doing syntax highlights.
- magit
- dsvn
